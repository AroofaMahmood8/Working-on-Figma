# Working-on-Figma
Certainly! Figma is a popular design tool that allows users to create and collaborate on interface designs, user experiences, and more. Here's how you can copy content from a link, paste it into Figma, resize it, and attach a link to it:

Copying Content from a Link and Pasting in Figma:

Find the Content: Start by finding the content you want to copy from a link. This could be an image, a piece of text, or any other visual element that you want to include in your Figma design.

Copy the Content: Right-click on the content or link, and select the "Copy" option from the context menu. Alternatively, you can use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl + C (Windows) or Command + C (Mac) to copy the content.

Open Figma: Open your Figma project where you want to paste the copied content.

Paste the Content: Right-click on the canvas in Figma or the specific frame/artboard where you want to place the copied content. Choose the "Paste" option from the context menu, or use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl + V (Windows) or Command + V (Mac) to paste the content onto the canvas.

Resizing the Pasted Content:

Select the Content: Click on the pasted content to select it. Handles (small squares) will appear around the content, indicating that it's selected.

Resize Handles: Move your cursor over one of the handles. When your cursor changes to a double-sided arrow, click and drag the handle to resize the content. Hold down the Shift key while resizing to maintain the content's aspect ratio (proportions).

Adjust Dimensions: As you drag the handles, you'll see dimensions (width and height) appear next to the content. You can also adjust these dimensions numerically by typing in the desired values.

Attaching a Link to the Content:

Select the Content: Click on the content to select it.

Add a Link: In the right-hand panel (the "Properties" panel), you'll find options related to the selected content. Look for an option that allows you to add a link. This might be labeled as "Link," "Hyperlink," or something similar.

Paste the Link: If there's a URL associated with the content you copied, paste it into the appropriate field in the Properties panel. Make sure you include the full URL, starting with "http://" or "https://".

Apply the Link: Once you've pasted the link, there might be a button to apply or save the link. Click this button to associate the link with the selected content.
